# Introduction

This site is build on [Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com). It's a Ruby-based static site generator, which has an asset pipeline for ERB/SCSS, templates for pages, and best of all, it's easily hackable . To install it, you need the Ruby language (a version number greater than 2.1), as well as RubyGems, a package management framework for Ruby. I recommend following using [RailsInstaller](http://railsinstaller.org/en) to set up the environment for a Ruby-based workflow.

Once those requirements are filled, you can install Middleman using the command `gem install middleman`. Depending on your Ruby installation, this may throw a permissions error, which in that case, you'd need to run `sudo gem install middleman`.
